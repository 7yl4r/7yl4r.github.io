			<h3>Gamified Education and Behavior Change</h3>
		</div>
		<p>
			I lead development of a space exploration edu-game
			called
			<a href="https://github.com/7yl4r/the-oregon-trajectory">The Oregon Trajectory</a>
			, published PhD dissertation based on my work in developing a modeling
			toolkit called
			<a href="http://pielab.github.io/behaviorSim_web/">BehaviorSim</a>
			 to aid health behavior change intervention design,
			 coded an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.usf.eng.pie.avatars4change">
				 android live wallpaper</a> designed to help kids
			 exercise more using only a cartoon avatar,
			 and have been a key contributor in development of the
			 <a href="https://github.com/rSimulate/Cosmosium">Cosmosium Engine</a> and
			 <a href="http://asteroid.ventures/">Asteroid Ventures Prototypes</a>.

			<h3>Teaching and HCI</h3>
		</div>
		<p>
			As a Physics/CS undergraduate at a small liberal arts college in 2008
			I discovered a passion for teaching sciences in my work as a computer science,
			physics, and math tutor for fellow undergraduates. Interacting with fellow students
			1-on-1 at this early stage in my career taught me
			how to adapt to individuals with different learning styles and backgrounds.
			As a graduate student I worked several semesters as a TA for Introduction to Circuits,
			and was able to hone my skills in lecturing and lesson planning.
			As my PhD work steered towards Human-Computer Interaction, I found myself teaching in less
			direct ways as I published and presented works designed to bridge a knowledge gap between
			Behavioral Science and Control Systems and programmed educational tools based on emerging
			theories of gamified learning and adaptive human-computer interfaces.
			In my current work as a Research Software Engineer I take every opportunity to share my
			knowledge of linux systems, programming, and data analysis with my collaborating
			postdocs and students. I have been enjoying the opportunity to share knowledge as 
			an adjunct professor teaching physics labs since 2020-01.

		<h3>Scientific Research and Data Science</h3></div>
		<p>
			I have explored, visualized, and published on a wide-ranging medley
			of scientific data. Some of my favorites include: a
			<a href="http://7yl4r.github.io/pulsarMap/">PulsarMapper</a>
			 to re-create the pioneer/voyager map (and more),
			 visualization methods for analyzing many
			behavioral intervention events
			(<a href="https://github.com/7yl4r/interventionViz/raw/master/template.pdf">interventionViz</a>),
			 an exploration of genetic algorithms within Conway’s game
			of Life (<a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/117413839180254151272">LifeGenes</a>).
			I firmly believe in Free and Open Source Software ideals. 
			I push for permissive licensing, open data, and have demonstrated dedication to these ideals 
			by averaging over 1800 public "contributions" per year for the last 5 years on github alone.

		<h3>FOSS+Linux Software for Systems and Data</h3></div>
		<p>
			I became a Linux advocate in 2007 and have never looked back. I run various distros on my
			personal computers as well as on my servers. Through my extremely diverse role at USF IMaRS
			I have been able to explore topics such as virtualization, containerization, cloud computing, 
			high-performance cluster computing, distributed storage, database design, task orchestration, 
			server maintainance, and software packaging.
			I particularly enjoy coding controllers, whether that
			means writing embedded C for a <a href="https://github.com/7yl4r/UVband">wearable UV dosimeter</a>,
			AI scripting for <a href="http://emergentorganization.github.io/bridge/">a game</a>,
			or using <a href="https://plus.google.com/+TylarMurray/posts/6cxvmzC8yK3">genetic
			neural networks</a> to give cells in Conway’s Game Life
			the power of movement. This passion and my coding
			skills pair well with my education in electrical
			engineering, physics, and human-computer interaction
			allowing me to also branch out into emerging
			robotic and IoT side projects when for when consumer products just don't quite scratch
			that itch for a particular physical technology.
