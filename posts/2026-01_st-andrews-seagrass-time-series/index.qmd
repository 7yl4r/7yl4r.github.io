An attempt was made to visualize seagrass change in select regions of St Andrew's Bay using Sentinel 2 imagery.

*The imact of Hurricane Michael seems apparent, but then the question is: what happened in 2021?*

-------------

Two areas of seagrass loss between 2020 and 2024 were manually identified using the IMaRS SIMM project seagrass .tif files.

Sentinel images were cloudmasked and the mean was taken from within these areas using [this GEE script](https://code.earthengine.google.com/8ef3cc2a42858a2ff19563288d4f313d).

The resulting values were downloaded as a .csv and imported into [this gsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s2DFIbGCChC2puwLrBrPqXgujDPrJ_vGxG375ZpRY5M/edit?usp=sharing).

The visualizations there were screenshotted into Inkscape and manually annotated.
